This is a report on analyzing and forecasting the stock price volatility based on data using ```ARIMA``` models, $\textbf{Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)}$, $\textbf{Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs)}$ and $\textbf{Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)}$. The global structure of the report is:

$\textbf{Part I. Data analysis and cleaning}$
  - Basic manipulation and analysis
  - Data cleaning
  - Data preparation


$\textbf{Part II. Statistical analysis}$
  - Statistical analysis of the volatility data
  - Time series analysis with ```ARIMA```

$\textbf{Part III. Deep learning models}$
  
  - Basic model: single-step, single-feature forecasting with LSTM
  - Generalized model: multi-step, multi-feature forcasting with LSTM
  - Advanced model: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with RNN and CNN. 

$\textbf{Part IV. Conclusions and Next steps}$
  - Conclusions
  - Next steps
